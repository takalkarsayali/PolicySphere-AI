# 🌐 PolicySphere AI

## Intelligent Company Policy Assistant

PolicySphere AI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload company policy PDFs and ask contextual questions. The system retrieves relevant policy sections using semantic search and generates answers strictly from the provided documents.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload multiple company policy PDFs
- 🧠 Semantic search using FAISS vector store
- 💬 Conversational memory (context-aware follow-up questions)
- 🔒 Strict prompt guardrails (no hallucinations)
- 📌 Source citation (File name + Page number)
- 🗂 Clean project structure (uploads separated from code)

## ⚙ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PolicySphere-AI.git
cd PolicySphere-AI
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in root directory:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

---

## ▶ Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. Upload one or more policy PDFs.
2. PDFs are stored in `data/uploads/`.
3. Documents are split into chunks.
4. Chunks are converted into embeddings.
5. Embeddings are stored in FAISS.
6. User question is converted into embedding.
7. Most relevant chunks are retrieved.
8. LLM generates answer strictly from retrieved context.
9. File name and page number are displayed as sources.

## 🔐 Strict Answering Policy

The system is designed to:

- Answer ONLY from uploaded documents
- Avoid assumptions
- Prevent hallucinations
- Return:  
  `"The policy document does not contain this information."`  
  if answer is not found

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- HR policy assistant
- Employee handbook Q&A
- Compliance document search
- Legal document retrieval
- Internal knowledge assistant

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Persist FAISS index to disk
- ChatGPT-style chat UI
- PDF page preview
- Multi-user authentication
- Cloud deployment
- Replace FAISS with Pinecone (for scalability)
